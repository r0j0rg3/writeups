## Solve
If we analyse the photo with Google Lens we see that this is Lisboa, we must "have a virtual tour" of the city to locate the building, but we can geolocate it with the views and the form of the balcony, and it's [Rua de Campolide 266](https://goo.gl/maps/5xDMAiG5RNzS1PBx6).

If we go to the street view and a few meters to the South-East we'll see that the pics are taken on the 2009 instead of the 2020, and on the "_new_" building we'll find the other numbers.
