## Solve
If we go to [this funny video](https://youtu.be/ZHReqKRvonE?t=33), at the second 0:33 we'll see _the Italian_, we can see that the restaurant name is **"RAVINTOLA PIZZERIA POMPEI"**, and the youtube channel is Universal Music **Finland**. Well, we have to search for a restaurant with this name in this country, easy, [here it is](https://es.restaurantguru.com/Pompei-Helsinki), and this is the street: _Snellmaninkatu 16, Helsinki, Uusimaa, Finland, 00170_.

Now we just have to select the street view and walk 10 meters to see the green man and woman...
